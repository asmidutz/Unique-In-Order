# Javascript-Challenges

**Challenge 1 - Unqiue In Order**
Implement the function unique_in_order which takes as argument a sequence and returns a list of items without any elements with the same value next to each other and preserving the original order of elements.

For example:

uniqueInOrder('AAAABBBCCDAABBB') == ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'A', 'B']

uniqueInOrder('ABBCcAD')         == ['A', 'B', 'C', 'c', 'A', 'D']

uniqueInOrder([1,2,2,3,3])       == [1,2,3]

**Challenge 2 - Reverse String**

Have the function FirstReverse(str) take the str parameter being passed and return the string in reversed order. For example: if the input string is "Hello World and Coders" then your program should return the string sredoC dna dlroW olleH.
Sample Test Cases
Input:"coderbyte"

Output:etybredoc


Input:"I Love Code"

Output:edoC evoL I

**Challenge 3 - Sum of Two Integers**

Task
Given Two integers a , b , find The sum of them , BUT You are not allowed to use the operators + and -

Notes
The numbers (a,b) may be positive , negative values or zeros .

Returning value will be an integer .

Javascript: the Array reduce methods are disabled, along with eval, require, and module .

**Challenge 4 - Bug challenge fix the array.**

Your friend has been out shopping for puppies (what a time to be alive!)... He arrives back with multiple dogs, and you simply do not know how to respond!

By repairing the function provided, you will find out exactly how you should respond, depending on the number of dogs he has.

The number of dogs will always be a number and there will always be at least 1 dog.


**Challenge 5 - Strong Number**

Definition
Strong number is the number that the sum of the factorial of its digits is equal to number itself.

For example: 145, since
1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145
So, 145 is a Strong number.

Task
Given a number, Find if it is Strong or not.
